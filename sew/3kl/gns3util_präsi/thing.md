Methodology und inspiration
---
Methodology
---
<!-- alignment: center -->
- Easy to automate
- good quality of life options
- don't hide options for more complex actions
    - but have an easy way to 80% of the needed actions
    - but expose enough for the last 20%
- use modern methods tools for the terminal like fuzzy finders

Inspiration
---
<!-- alignment: center -->
> Inspired by modern CLI-Tooling such as
- nvim telescope
- tmux sesionx
- k3sup
- docker context and kubectl

Tooling
---

**1. Development & Build Tools**
<!-- alignment: center -->
*   **uv**
    *  Modern Python tooling to manage:
        *   virtual environments
        *   Python versions
        *   pip
        *   and more
*   **docker**
    *   To test the program isolated.
*   **make**
    * To automate common tasks:
        *   building and running the Docker image
        *   publishing the newest version of the package
*   **git** / **lazygit**
    *   Version control (`lazygit` for easier use of `git`).
